# DailyPulse

A minimalist mood tracking app built with Flutter. Track your emotions, understand patterns, and maintain your mental well-being.

**Inspired by beautiful designs from Dribbble**

## Overview

DailyPulse is a modern mood tracking application that helps users monitor their emotional well-being through a clean, intuitive interface. Built with Flutter, the app provides a seamless experience for logging daily moods, viewing historical patterns, and gaining insights into emotional trends. The app uses a 6-level emotion scale (Terrible, Bad, Okay, Good, Great, Angry) with emoji-based visual representation, making mood tracking quick and effortless.

The application follows an offline-first architecture, ensuring that users can log their moods anytime, anywhere, without depending on internet connectivity. All mood entries are instantly saved to local storage using Hive, and then automatically synchronized to Firebase Firestore in the background when connectivity is available. This approach guarantees data persistence and provides a smooth, lag-free user experience.

DailyPulse demonstrates modern Flutter development practices with clean architecture, efficient state management using Provider, and a feature-based project structure. The app supports both light and dark themes with smooth transitions, includes Firebase authentication for secure user management, and provides insightful analytics with time-based filtering (week, month, all time). The minimalist design, inspired by Dribbble's best mood tracking interfaces, focuses on reducing visual clutter while maintaining functionality and aesthetic appeal.

**State Management:** Provider for global state, setState for local UI state  
**Data Flow:** Local-first (Hive) → Background sync (Firestore)

## Emotion Logic

### Mood Scale (0-5)
| Level | Emoji | Label | Color |
|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| 0 | 😢 | Terrible | Pink |
| 1 | 😕 | Bad | Orange |
| 2 | 😐 | Okay | Yellow |
| 3 | 🙂 | Good | Green |
| 4 | 😄 | Great | Purple |
| 5 | 😡 | Angry | Red |

### Analytics Calculation

**Average Mood:**
```dart
avgMood = sum(all mood levels) / total entries
```

**Mood Distribution:**
```dart
percentage = (count of specific mood / total entries) × 100
```

**Time Filtering:**
- Week: Entries from last 7 days
- Month: Entries from last 30 days
- All: All recorded entries

### Design Choices

**Pastel Colors:** Calming, reduces visual stress  
**Emoji-First:** Universal, instant recognition  
**Minimalist UI:** Focus on emotions, not interface  
**Offline-First:** Always available, instant saves  
**Dark Mode:** Eye comfort, battery saving
